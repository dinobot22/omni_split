        "text": "LLMs in game-theoretic environments  Understanding strategic behaviors of LLMs entails important societal ramifications, as online users increasingly rely on intelligent assistants to interact with other agents, potentially also LLMs. To characterize LLM's behaviors, prior studies [23, 24, 19, 18, 25, 26, 27, 28] often adopt game theory, a mathematical framework that models cooperative behaviors of humans. These analyses involve comparing qualitative behaviors of LLM interactions against stylized entities, such as pareto optimal solutions and subgame-perfect equilibria [29]. LLM research in game-theoretic environments belongs to a growing body of work on multi-agent LLMs [30] and their evaluation [31, 32]. In particular, AvalonBench [33] serves as a valuable platform for developing new multi-agent strategies. [28, 34] observe LLMs to perform in games driven by self-interest, but falter in those that require coordination, a behavior that emerges under altruistic and/or submissive personalities [25, 28]. [35, 36] observe different LLM families to exhibit varying levels of risk tolerance. Deferring details to experiments, we identify another source of brittleness as LLMs behave poorly when presented with numerically perturbed payoffs, even if they do not alter qualitative solutions to the game of interest. In short, there lacks a system that elicits optimal behaviors for LLMs in game-theoretic settings. ",

[37] proposes an LLM-based self-play algorithm that emulates Monte-Carlo Tree Search to solve zero-sum games. Broadly, these methods belong to a family of prompting strategies [38, 39, 40] that tackle decision making instances. Our method is no exception, but differs as we imbue classical game theory in LLMs to allow for fine-grained control and analyses at each information state.. ",

They represent a minimal setting characterized by small action spaces, limited number of terms, and the existence of analytical equilibria; yet they cannot capture complex interactions of real-world, multi-agent dialogues. Games that emulate real interactions are more challenging to analyze, but practically useful. Exemplar games in this category include Deal-or-No-Deal [22], Multi-Round Auction [27], Schedule-a-Meeting, Trading Fruit, Public Debate [23], Avalon [33], Pokemon [41], Chess [37] and Bargaining [42]. And there are efforts to collect multiple games and evaluate them [32]. They often involve intractable action spaces (e.g. natural language) and do not attain analytical solutions; but they are nevertheless endowed with a well-defined payoff function for practitioners to analyze the optimality of their strategy, albeit in an end-to-end manner.

Effect of Negotiation Without Workflow: In the absence of the workflow, negotiation tends to systematically shift the strategies of LLMs away from the Nash Equilibrium toward non-equilibrium pareto optimal strategies, with the exception of model o1.   \n: LLM Performance With Workflow: The implementation of the workflow markedly enhances the performance of LLMs in game-theoretic contexts.

The agents may be influenced by negotiation dialogues to consider alternative strategies. Nevertheless, unlike the scenario without the workflow, negotiation does not systematically shift the agents toward pareto optimal strategies at the. expense of Nash Equilibrium compliance. ",

This necessitates the creation of a meta-strategy or meta-workflow that guides the selection of appropriate negotiation strategies based on the specific context, the agent's own abilities, the stage of the game, and the behavior of the opponent. Implementing such a meta-strategy would enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of LLMs across diverse negotiation scenarios. ",

To function as proficient negotiation agents, it is imperative for LLMs to learn and adopt stances that reflect the interests they represent. This involves training LLMs to understand and advocate for particular objectives, thereby balancing their general alignment with the capacity to pursue defined goals within negotiations. Developing methods to instill a clear understanding of their own interests will enhance the LLMs' ability to engage in strategic decision-making and achieve desired outcomes. ",
